excerpt: "Fall 2015 midterm project for CSCI 371: Computational Graphics.

Working alongside eight other students, we built a procedural building and city
generator using the G3D graphics engine in the span of two weeks. Our buildings
were generated by using a stack-based grammar. Model primitives were built
by hand using Blender. We shot a demo film showcasing our system, and presented
our work during Williams College CS [colloquium](https://csci.williams.edu/ward-prize-nomination-presentation/) May 2015.
This project won the 2015 Ward Prize for best project in computer science.
