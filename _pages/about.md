I grew up in the awesome little city of Charlottesville, VA. When I'm not working or coding, I am listening to music, traveling, reading, or [praising
the sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls).

In a past life I played competitive golf, and I still enjoy getting out on the links from time to time.
