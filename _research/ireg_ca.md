This work was my Williams College computer science honors thesis, advised by
Duane Bailey. My thesis defense won the Sam Goldberg Colloquium Prize for best
thesis presentation in the CS department.
This work was also accepted to the [Conference on Complex Systems 2017](http://ccs17.unam.mx/)
and presented as a poster.

## Abstract
Dynamic, spatially-oriented systems found in nature such as plant cell arrays or ant colonies can produce complex behavior without centralized coordination or control. Instead, they communicate locally, with these local interactions producing emergent behavior globally across the entire system. The essence of these decentralized systems can be captured utilizing cellular automata (CA) modeling, and such models are utilized for investigating and simulating such natural systems. However, CA models assume spatial regularity and structure, which are certainly not present in natural systems. In fact, natural systems are inherently robust to spatial irregularities and environmental noise. In this work, we relax the assumption of spatial regularity when considering cellular automata in order to investigate the conditions in which complex behavior can emerge in noisy, irregular natural systems.
