This work was a 2015 undergraduate research project led by Professor Duane Bailey. Alongside four other students, we investigated theoretical properties of [_curling number sequences_](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2382), described below,  and developed computational methods for searching through the sequence generation space. My contributions were primarily in investigating _rotten sequences_, which are starting sequences that, when prepended with an additional digit, actually produce shorter tails.

## Abstract
The curling number, \\(cn(S)\\), of a finite non-empty sequence of digits \\(S\\) is the maximum \\(k\\) such that \\(S\\) can be written as \\(XY^k\\) where \\(X\\) can be empty. The current sequence is the expansion of \\(S_0 = S\\) by appending the curling number: \\(S_{i+1} = S_i cn(S_i)\\). The _curling number conjecture_ states that every curling sequence eventually terminates with a curling number of 1. We present new results of _(2,3)-curling sequences_, sequences composed of 2's and 3's. We demonstrate an interesting relationship between the tails of curling sequences and words in a set of aperiodic _curling grammars._ We demonstrate the existence of a _doubly infinite curling sequence_ that appears consistent with the iterated growth of (2, 3)-curling sequences and prove a number of interesting results. We also report new data on the numbers of unstable sequences, including _rotten sequences_ up to length 48 and _active sequences_ up to length 42.
