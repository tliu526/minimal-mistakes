## Abstract
Red-Black trees are often considered to be a data structure too complex to implement or teach effectively. We aim to show that a few slight modifications to the Red-Black tree can provide a simpler and lighter weight implementation, called the Left-Leaning Red Black Tree. Within its operations it prefers to hang nodes to the left when possible, which allows procedures like _add_, _remove_, and _contains_ to be implemented with relatively simple recursive calls. Testing our implementation of a Left-Leaning Red Black Tree against other similar data structures has shown us that it is competitive in both run-time and length of code.
